# Dev Resources

## Background
I have working knowledge of HTML/CSS before I started so I have not included any basic HTML/CSS tutorials down below. There's a lot of great sites which cater to beginners (for a fee) like Codecademy, CodeSchool, Treehouse, Udemy, Udacity, etc. But I did not include them here because I do not want to review each services. Though I did personally went for Treehouse (and went half way through their techdegree) I found that long video tutorials are simply not for me (Well, there's sites like egghead.io but then I have to list all of the myriads of paid intermediate level resources, so, No). The takeaway, if any, is to choose the kind of resources that are right for you and not give up learning.

### Podcasts
(I've included podcasts because I personally think it's a good way to gauge your knowledge and to know what's out there especially if you're not part of a developer circle or network. Another method is to join Slack channels. Some of the resources above and below have their own slack channel, find out and join)
